### ---- Assignment task 1 ---- 

##
##You should be able to easily answer the following questions:

##  1. What is an odds function?
## Answer: Odds function is equivalent to the exponential function of OLS 
## regression. So Odds = exp(b0 + b1*x1 + ... + bn*xn), where odds = p(x)/1-p(x), 
## given that p(x) is a probability that dependent variable equals a case.

##  2. What is an odds ratio?
## Answer: In case of a continuous independent variable the odds ratio is defined 
## as OR = odds(x+1)/odds(x), where odds(x) = p(x)/1-p(x) = exp(b0 + b1*x1). 
## The bn*xn is skipped for simplicity, so OR = exp(b0 + b1*(x1+1))/exp(b0 + b1*x1), 
## which gives us the final form OR = e(b1). In case of binary independent variable,
## OR = a*b/c*d, where a, b, c, d are the probabilities in the contingency table of independent
## variable. 

##  3. What is a log-odds function?
## Logs-odds function is  defined as log(p(x)/1-p(x)) = b0 + b1*x1 + ... + bn*xn
##  4. What is a logistic function?
## Logistic function has a sigmoid shape and is defined as -- again the case of 
## one dependent variable is taken for simplicity, -- P(x)= 1/1+exp(-(b0 + b1*x1))
##  5. What is the relationship between predicted probabilities and predicted odds? 

## 6. What is a pseudo-R-square?

##  7. How do you interpret the results of the logistic regression?

### ---- Assignment task 2 ---- 
## Compute corresponding probabilities for the log-odds above. Are triangles significant in our model?

# if the tie will not add any triangles to the network, its log-odds is: -1.680
P2_1 <- invlogit(flomodel.02$coef[1])
P2_1
# if the tie will add one triangle to the network, its log-odds is: -1.680+0.169=-1.510
P2_2 <- invlogit(flomodel.02$coef[1]+flomodel.02$coef[2])
P2_2
# if a tie will add two triangles to the network, its log-odds is: -1.680+0.169x2=-1.341
P2_3 <- invlogit(flomodel.02$coef[1]+2*flomodel.02$coef[2])
P2_3
#Answer: the coefficient of triangles is not significant as p-value is 0.75 (>0.1)

# As both estimate coefficients are significant(p-value = 0.0001, 0.0241 < 0.1), we can claim: 
# - that with an addition of a tie, but without the addition of main effect of covariate the log odds is -2.594929, so the influence
# on the tie formation is negative. 
# - that without an addition of a tie, but with the addition of main effect of covariate the log odds is 0.010546, so the influence
# on the tie formation is positive

# We also can compute how those additions can change the probability of tie formation

# of tie formation to decrease by 93%.

# With the increase of sum of wealth of nodes i and j by one point, but zero ties, we expect the probability of tie formation
# to increase by 1.06%.
