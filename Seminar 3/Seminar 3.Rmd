## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## ----- Assignment question 2 ----- 
#Given the explanation of transitivity provided, how do you evaluate 
# the transitivity coefficient obtained with the above command?

gtrans(flo.marriage, measure='weak')
## Let us create one random directed graph with the same amount of nodes
num_nodes <- 16
my_matrix<-matrix(round(runif(num_nodes*num_nodes)), ncol = num_nodes)
diag(my_matrix) <- 0

my_network<-as.network(x = my_matrix, directed = TRUE )
gtrans(my_network, measure='weak')

# The observed figure of transitivity is less than random figures. Thus, in Medici's 
# times, families tend to form less ties than possible. It gives us a hint that 
# something restricts them from creating possible connections.

# ----- Assignment question 3 ----- 
# Here, we showed you how to calculate this measure and its different types,
# but the information you get will be meaningless. Why?.

grecip(flo.marriage, measure = 'dyadic') # why not 0?

grecip(flo.marriage, measure = 'dyadic.nonnull')

grecip(flo.marriage, measure = 'edgewise')

grecip(flo.marriage, measure = 'edgewise.lrr')

grecip(flo.marriage, measure = 'correlation')

# Answer: In that case, those commands are meaningless, because ties represent
# marriage and business relations which are reciprocal by definition.


# Assignment 5
load('flo.Rdata')

flo.graph<-asIgraph(flo.marriage)

# here is another method in measuring distances

# Assignment 6

#1) Take a careful look at the table with Florentine family centralities. 
#Can you figure out why the name "Medici" is familiar to us, and others 
#- not so much? Which centrality, in your opinion, is the most
#"responsible"" for this?

library('CINNA')

#First, extract components from the flo.graph network:
comps<-graph_extract_components(flo.graph)

Comp1<-comps[[1]] #We use the first component to extract centralities from
pr_cent<-proper_centralities(Comp1)

NewCent<-calculate_centralities(Comp1, include = c(pr_cent[1:5], pr_cent[19]))

NewCent<-as.data.frame(NewCent)

node<-c(as.character(flo.att$flo.names[1:11]),as.character(flo.att$flo.names[13:16]))

#Add a column of names to the table
NewCent<-data.frame(node,NewCent, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

library('knitr')

names(NewCent)<-c("Family", "Alpha", "Bonacich", "Page Rank", "Average Distance", "BaryCenter","Katz")
kable(NewCent, digits=3, caption = "Florentine Families' Additional Network Centralities")

# the most responsible for this is Average Distance as it shows the smallest centrality for Medici

#3) From the long list of possible centralities, pick any five, plus Bonacich, Page Rank, and Katz, to analyze
#for Florentine families.
#• Obviously, this should not be random. READ about centralities and find the ones that you would
#think are appropriate for the Florentine families.
#• Briefly describe the chosen centralities. You will see why I chose Bonacich, Page Rank and Katz
#for you to learn.
#• Create a nice-looking table of these centralities for Florentine Families.
#• Look at Medici now. Did any of your conclusions (from above) change? What have you learned
#with these new centralities that was not obvious earlier?


Cent1<-calculate_centralities(Comp1, include = c(pr_cent[2:3], pr_cent[19:21], pr_cent[31], pr_cent[35], pr_cent[45]))
Cent1<-as.data.frame(NewCent)

node<-c(as.character(flo.att$flo.names[1:11]),as.character(flo.att$flo.names[13:16]))

Cent1<-data.frame(node,Cent1, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

library('knitr')

names(Cent1)<-c("Family", "Bonacich", "Page Rank", "Katz", "Kleinberg's authority centrality scores",
                "Kleinberg's hub centrality scores", "Community Centrality", "Laplacian Centrality", "Information Centrality")
kable(Cent1, digits=3, caption = "Florentine Families' Additional Network Centralities")

# "Bonacich", "Page Rank", "Katz" are somehow related to eigenvector, so that'll be the hint in choice of other centraliies
