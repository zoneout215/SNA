## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## ----- Assignment question 2 ----- 
#Given the explanation of transitivity provided, how do you evaluate 
# the transitivity coefficient obtained with the above command?

gtrans(flo.marriage, measure='weak')
## Let us create one random directed graph with the same amount of nodes
num_nodes <- 16
my_matrix<-matrix(round(runif(num_nodes*num_nodes)), ncol = num_nodes)
diag(my_matrix) <- 0

my_network<-as.network(x = my_matrix, directed = TRUE )
gtrans(my_network, measure='weak')

# The observed figure of transitivity is less than random figures. Thus, in Medici's 
# times, families tend to form less ties than possible. It gives us a hint that 
# something restricts them from creating possible connections.

# ----- Assignment question 3 ----- 
# Here, we showed you how to calculate this measure and its different types,
# but the information you get will be meaningless. Why?.

grecip(flo.marriage, measure = 'dyadic') # why not 0?

grecip(flo.marriage, measure = 'dyadic.nonnull')

grecip(flo.marriage, measure = 'edgewise')

grecip(flo.marriage, measure = 'edgewise.lrr')

grecip(flo.marriage, measure = 'correlation')

# Answer: In that case, those commands are meaningless, because ties represent
# marriage and business relations which are reciprocal by definition.
